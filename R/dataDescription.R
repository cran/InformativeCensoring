##' Simulated time to event data with 5 time independent covariates

##' This dataset is inspired by the simulation described in Hsu and Taylor,

##' @field arm factor for treatment group control=0, active=1
##' @field Z1 binary time independent covariate
##' @field Z2 continuous time independent covariate
##' @field Z3 binary time independent covariate
##' @field Z4 continuous time independent covariate
##' @field Z5 binary time independent covariate
##' @field event event indicator (1 yes, 0 no)
##' @field time subject censoring/event time (in years)
##' @field to.impute logical, should an event time be imputed for this subject?
##' (this is ignored if subject has event time)
##' @field DCO.time The time the subject would have been censored if they had not
